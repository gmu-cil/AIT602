"I 'm saying uh it was good because it could, rather than have a neighborhood just fall down and be vacant and just in variable shape, impact the value which is going down and down, you could step in and reinvest in these neighborhoods by fixing up buildings, fixing up homes, and fixing up infrastructure to maintain the value and the health and safety of the uh of the occupants that are living in the neighborhood.",,,
"the  initial  owners  get  older, the  kids  get older, the kids move on out somewhere else, and the uh the uh adults are left there and uh either they sell the property or some of the kids stay there or whatever but, the as the as the property ages, uh if the  families that live  in  that  neighborhood  cannot  take  care  of  them  or  if  they  sell  them  to  an investor  who  is  just  an  income-producer  for  them....Um,  investor  owners,  you  know, smart  ones take care of their property",,,

"they  have  very  little  education programs  and  social  programs  for  for  a  lot  of  the  public  housing,  uh  and  it  has  created  a  real problem because housing authorities are warehousing extremely low income people without a lot of the good programs that could help residents move up and out.",,,
"I think urban renewal just accelerates a natural process, uh and and the example of that is: you take a neighborhood, a brand new neighborhood and you've got young families are in it, and as I've mentioned  the  process  before, the  uh  the  initial  owners  get  older, the  kids  get older, the kids move on out somewhere else, and the uh the uh adults are left there and uh either they sell the property or some of the kids stay there or whatever but, the as the as the property ages, uh if the  families that live  in  that  neighborhood  cannot  take  care  of  them  or  if  they  sell  them  to  an investor  who  is  just  an  income-producer  for  them",,,

"But you lost that, the good role models there of the higher income folks that were were neighbors to uh to the lower income, so...And once, and we won't get into politics here but, it's the Republicans that reduced all these  benefits  uh  to  where  they  don't  have  childcare  now,  and  they  have  very  little  education programs  and  social  programs  for  for  a  lot  of  the  public  housing,  uh  and  it  has  created  a  real problem because housing authorities are warehousing extremely low income people without a lot of the good programs that could help residents move up and out.",,,

"so urban renewal could step in and stop the deterioration and extend the economic life of the neighborhood for another twenty-five, thirty years, so it was a good process.

the previous two years, or previous five years, uh for two years and then the
third year they would they would cut twenty-five percent from your money, and
the fourth year they would limit fifty percent of the money that you were
entitled to, and then after the last year you are on your own to raise your
taxes of whatever to to provide the resources for the programs that your city
felt were valid and necessary.[kd1]",,,
